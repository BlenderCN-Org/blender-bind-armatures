Blender *Bind Armatures* operator
======================

Overview
----------
This operator binds a simple game-ready armature to a Rigify or advanced MakeHuman armature. The binding is done via Copy Transforms constraints on the deform bones of the armatures.

Usage
------
The operator can be invoked in **Object Mode** by selecting the simple armature, pressing the spacebar in the 3D View, and typing in **Bind Armatures**. A popup will then be displayed where you can select the more complex target armature from a drop-down list.
